# Crime-Analysis-Dashboard
**OverView**

In this project, we take a deep dive into crime data across various European countries, aiming to uncover patterns and trends that can provide insights into the types of crimes and their occurrences.

Total Crimes:
We begin by analyzing the total number of reported crimes across all countries in the dataset. This provides a foundational understanding of the overall crime burden in Europe, giving a broad view of how crime affects different regions.

Crime Distribution by Year and Yearly Changes:
Next, we explore how crime has evolved over time. By categorizing crimes by year, we gain insights into year-over-year changes. Are crimes increasing, decreasing, or remaining steady? This section helps to highlight any significant shifts in crime trends, possibly revealing the impact of policy changes, social factors, or economic conditions.

Crimes by Time Range:
Time plays a crucial role in crime analysis. Here, we break down crime occurrences by specific time intervals, such as 3:00 AM to 5:59 AM. This helps us understand when crimes are most likely to occur and whether certain times of day or night are more prone to criminal activity. Knowing this can be critical for preventive measures and law enforcement resource allocation.

Heatmap Showing Crime Distribution by Weekdays and Months:
To further illustrate when crimes are most likely to happen, we visualize crime distribution using a heatmap. This heatmap compares crime rates across different weekdays and months, offering a clear view of seasonal trends or whether crime peaks during particular days of the week.

Crimes by Country:
Next, we examine the geographic spread of crime by analyzing how crimes are distributed by country. This allows us to compare the crime rates between countries and possibly identify which regions have higher or lower crime prevalence. Understanding country-specific factors influencing crime can aid in developing targeted prevention strategies
